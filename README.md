# docker-android-sdk-nodejs

Docker container with Android SDK, Node.JS and Gradle

Based on official node image and then extended with Android SDK based on https://github.com/mindrunner/docker-android-sdk and https://hub.docker.com/r/runmymind/docker-android-sdk
Also adds latest version of Gradle as you likely need that if you want to do anything with the Android SDK
